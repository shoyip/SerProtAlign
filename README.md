# Serine Protease Alignment

This repository contains the codebase (libraries, codes, notebooks, scripts) for
performing alignments of the Serine Protease family.

## How is the family defined

We can use multiple definitions, they are slightly different between each other:

- The MEROPS database has the S1A Subfamily
- The Pfam database defines the PF00089 Trypsin Family
- We use a manual selection given by Halabi
